# OS-HW3
  This C++ code demonstrates memory address translation using a simple paging mechanism. It initializes a page/frame table where logical page numbers are mapped to physical frame numbers. The translateLogicalToPhysical function calculates the page number and offset for a given logical address. If the page number exists in the table, it retrieves the corresponding frame number and computes the physical address by adding the offset to the base address of the frame. The program outputs the logical address, page number, offset, and physical address. It also handles page faults for non-existent pages. The main function initializes the page/frame table and translates sample input logical addresses to physical addresses for demonstration. For my code, I hardcoded the logical addresses as 0x3A7F, 0xABCD, and 0x5678
